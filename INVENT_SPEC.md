Evaluate how clean and non-distracting the background and surrounding space are in relation to the cat. Score whether the cat stands out clearly as the subject of the photograph or whether it is lost in a visual crowd of competing elements. Penalize scattered objects, bold patterns, bright signage, other animals, or a general tangle of visual information behind and around the cat that fractures the viewer's focus and pulls attention away from the subject. The background does not need to be empty or sterile — a bookshelf, a garden, or a kitchen counter can serve well — but it must remain visually secondary to the cat. What matters is visual hierarchy: does the surrounding space respect the cat's role as the center of attention, allowing the viewer's eye to settle naturally on the subject, or does it compete with the cat, creating a cluttered and chaotic visual field where the subject is difficult to isolate and appreciate?
