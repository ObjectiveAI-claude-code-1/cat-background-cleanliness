Task 1 — Assess Visual Hierarchy: Examine the photograph and determine whether the cat commands the viewer's attention as the clear, dominant subject of the image. Evaluate the visual weight of the background relative to the cat — consider whether the surrounding space stays subordinate through calm tones, muted colors, and unassuming textures, or whether it asserts itself through bold patterns, vivid colors, or eye-catching elements that rival the cat for visual prominence. The background does not need to be empty; a bookshelf, garden, or kitchen counter can serve beautifully as a backdrop. What matters is whether the background defers to the cat, allowing the viewer's eye to land on the subject naturally and without effort, or whether it has risen to the level of the subject, reducing the cat to just one element among many in a visually flat composition where nothing stands out as primary.

Task 2 — Evaluate Distraction Density: Identify and assess the specific competing elements present in the background and surrounding space that fracture the viewer's focus away from the cat. Look for individual visual interruptions — scattered household objects, bright signage, bold geometric patterns, glowing screens, cluttered surfaces, and especially other animals, which are uniquely powerful distractions because they are subjects in their own right and create an irresolvable competition for the viewer's attention. Consider how these distractions accumulate: a single coffee mug beside the cat may be forgiven, but when that mug sits among a stack of mail, a phone charger, and a half-eaten plate of food, the background ceases to be a backdrop and becomes an inventory of visual noise that happens to contain a cat. Assess both the number and the attention-grabbing intensity of competing elements in the frame.

Task 3 — Evaluate Spatial Harmony: Assess whether the background and surrounding space cohere into a calm, ordered, unified visual field, or whether they feel chaotic, fragmented, and restless. A background can have relatively few individual distractions and still feel disorganized if its elements share no visual relationship — tangled cables, furniture at odd angles, and mismatched textures colliding without rhythm or reason. Conversely, a background with some content can feel deeply harmonious if its elements belong together naturally, as in a garden where leaves, flowers, and earth form a coherent environment, or a kitchen counter with a few well-placed items that complement one another. Evaluate the emotional register of the space: does it feel settled and calm, inviting the viewer to relax into the image and appreciate the cat, or does it create visual anxiety and unease? Recognize that cleanliness is not the absence of content but the presence of order — a space that knows how to support its subject without demanding attention for itself.
